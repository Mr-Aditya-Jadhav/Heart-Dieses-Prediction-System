  Heart disease is the one of the most common disease. We will use different attributes which can
relate to this heart diseases well to find the better method to predict and we will also use
algorithms for prediction. Naive Bayes, algorithm is analyzed on dataset based on risk factors.
We will also use decision trees and combination of algorithms for the prediction of heart disease
based on the attributes from dataset. Machine Learning have remarkable features that simplify
the identification of unseen patterns, eventually providing clinical insights that assist physicians
in planning and providing care. In this Project, the presence of heart disease is predicted by
employing Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression
(LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and some other classifying Algorithms and F1-
score will be estimated to analyze the performance and a comparative study of these Algorithms.
Generally, it is estimated that when the dataset is small naive Bayes algorithm gives the accurate
results and when the dataset is large decision trees gives the accurate results. Following are the
key features of this project.

Health care data contains hidden information which is useful for making effective decisions.
This can help patients in getting a quick diagnosis with a lot less cost
We are using various machine learning techniques for predicting heart disease such as
SVM, Decision tree classifier, Random Forest, Linear regression, Logistic regression, Naïve
Bayes 

We will analyze different algorithms and will figure out which algorithm works good for particular
dataset and accordingly will use for prediction of heart dieses. This work will attempt to predict
the presence of heart disease by utilizing Base learners, Ensemble combination rules and Ensemble
classifiers. To detect which method can be used

The presence of heart disease is predicted by employing Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) & Random Forest (RF),
Ensemble combination rules i.e., Majority Voting & Weighted Average Voting and Ensemble
classifiers i.e., Bagging, Adaptive Boosting. Parameters such as Accuracy,
Precision, Recall and F1-score were estimated to analyze the performance and a comparative study
of these classifiers was carried out.

The Heart Disease dataset will be taken from Kaggle. This database contains 76 attributes,
but for sake of understanding we will use a subset of 14 of them. It has a total number of 303 rows
and 14 columns among which 165 have a heart disease.
