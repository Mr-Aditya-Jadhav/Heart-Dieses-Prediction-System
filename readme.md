Heart disease is the one of the most common disease. We will use different attributes which can
relate to this heart diseases well to find the better method to predict and we will also use
algorithms for prediction. Naive Bayes, algorithm is analyzed on dataset based on risk factors.
We will also use decision trees and combination of algorithms for the prediction of heart disease
based on the attributes from dataset. Machine Learning have remarkable features that simplify
the identification of unseen patterns, eventually providing clinical insights that assist physicians
in planning and providing care. In this Project, the presence of heart disease is predicted by
employing Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes, Logistic Regression
(LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and some other classifying Algorithms and F1-
score will be estimated to analyze the performance and a comparative study of these Algorithms.
Generally, it is estimated that when the dataset is small naive Bayes algorithm gives the accurate
results and when the dataset is large decision trees gives the accurate results. Following are the
key features of this project.
Improvement on Heart Disease Prediction technique by correctly adjusting the Random Forest
Machine Learning Model (85.81% accuracy).
Health care data contains hidden information which is useful for making effective decisions.
This can help patients in getting a quick diagnosis with a lot less cost
We are using various machine learning techniques for predicting heart disease such as
KNN, SVM, Decision tree classifier, Random Forest, Linear regression, Logistic regression, Na誰ve
Bayes, Linear descriptive analysis, Gaussian na誰ve Bayes. Out of all the algorithms, we found the
best algorithm Decision tree that gives accurate results and used in the future for predicting heart
disease at the earliest level and can take preventive measures. The Research work contributes the
correlative application and analysis of various machine-learning algorithms in the python software,
which is used to early expectation of the heart disease. Future work includes distinctive ensemble
methods of these algorithms that can progress to better execution with more parameter setting
using diverse machine-learning algorithms.
We will analyze different algorithms and will figure out which algorithm works good for particular
dataset and accordingly will use for prediction of heart dieses. This work will attempt to predict
the presence of heart disease by utilizing Base learners, Ensemble combination rules and Ensemble
classifiers. To detect which method can be used


The presence of heart disease is predicted by employing Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) & Random Forest (RF),
Ensemble combination rules i.e., Majority Voting & Weighted Average Voting and Ensemble
classifiers i.e., Bagging, Adaptive Boosting & Gradient Boosting. Parameters such as Accuracy,
Precision, Recall and F1-score were estimated to analyze the performance and a comparative study
of these classifiers was carried out.
The Heart Disease dataset will be taken from Kaggle. This database contains 76 attributes,
but for sake of understanding we will use a subset of 14 of them. It has a total number of 303 rows
and 14 columns among which 165 have a heart disease.
For this purpose, we will use panda's library. A line graph and bar graph are plotted to demonstrate
the interrelationship between Age & Heart disease and Gender & Heart disease, respectively. From
the line graph, it can be concluded that in the age group ranging from 41-60 years, the rate of heart
disease is the highest. Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact the model
performance. So, in order to achieve better accuracy for our model we identified the highly
important features from the dataset by implementing a feature selection method i.e., Correlation
Matrix with Heatmap. Correlation states how the features are related to each other or the target
variable. Correlation can be positive or negative. We will split the dataset in the ratio 70:30 to
create training and testing subsets. Base learners are the normal machine learning algorithms. In
this analysis SVM, Multinomial NB, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest are
regarded as the base learners. Confusion matrix is considered to describe the performance of these
classifiers. Ensemble learning combines & diverse set of individual models or classifiers together
to improvise the stability and predictive power of the model. The predictions made by each base
learner is given as an input to Majority voting and Weighted Average voting
